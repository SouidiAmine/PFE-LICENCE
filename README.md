# Hand Rehabilitation Interactive Game using Kinect

## Overview

Over the course of a lifetime, humans can face disabilities as a result of accidents or illnesses. These disabilities can make even the simplest tasks challenging. The primary goal of rehabilitation is to enable patients to regain the use of their limbs, with the hand being one of the most crucial. However, traditional rehabilitation sessions can be exhausting and psychologically repetitive for both patients and therapists.

To address this, we have developed an interactive game that allows patients to continue their hand rehabilitation while having fun. This game also aids therapists in facilitating precise gesture training. The core concept revolves around utilizing gesture recognition through the Kinect sensor, which serves as the patient's means of interaction with the game.

## Key Features

- **Serious Games:** Our application combines serious rehabilitation with an engaging gaming experience, motivating patients to actively participate in their treatment.

- **Hand Rehabilitation:** The game focuses on hand rehabilitation exercises, helping patients regain dexterity and strength in their hands.

- **Recognition of Hand Gestures:** We employ Kinect technology to accurately recognize and track the patient's hand gestures, ensuring effective rehabilitation.

- **Human-Machine Interaction:** The game promotes interactive therapy, allowing patients to interact with virtual elements using natural hand movements.

- **Segmentation:** Precise segmentation of hand movements is essential for effective rehabilitation, and our system achieves this by leveraging Kinect's capabilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Kinect Sensor
- Appropriate Kinect SDK


## Usage

To use this application for hand rehabilitation, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you are positioned between 0.5 meters and 3 meters in front of the Kinect sensor.

2. It is better to be in a bright place.
